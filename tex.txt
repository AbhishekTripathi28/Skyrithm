in module structure the cade will run only 1 time regardless how meny time the perticular module will import or call

the way to call the function --
regular fn call - fn()
constructor - new fn() 
call () - call the fn with the given this(context)
apply() call the fn with given array of this 
bind () return the fn after calling the fn with given this 
arrow fn 
IIFE - (()=> {})(),
       2nd way - +function name (){

                                   }()
callback
fn constructor - eg: const fn = new function ("a", "b", "return a+b");
fn (10,10) 
eval- its deprecated coz it run the str eg: const str="console.log(1)"; eval (str) -- it run and print 1
